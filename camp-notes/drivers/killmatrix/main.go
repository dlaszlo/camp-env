// Command killmatrix interrupts the privileged half of 'camp up' at each
// boundary and requires camp to recover from its record alone.
//
// What it answers, and why it cannot be answered by reading the code:
// camp's write-ahead record claims to be sufficient on its own. A run
// killed anywhere between the first mount and the front end's save leaves
// the machine in one of eight states, and in every one of them the record
// -- with the configuration deleted -- has to be enough to take the whole
// composition apart, or to say exactly what it could not remove. Whether
// that is true is a property of the machine after a kill, and the only way
// to know it is to kill it.
//
// For each boundary it: arms the barrier to kill the helper where it
// stands, runs 'camp up', renames the configuration away, and runs
// 'camp down'. Then it requires, from the review's own list:
//
//   - every mount id camp created has disappeared;
//   - no unrelated mount id has disappeared;
//   - the repositories and the storage hash identically before and after;
//   - the record survives until every place is clean;
//   - anything that could not be removed is named exactly.
//
// It also requires that 'camp status', with no configuration on disk,
// still describes the composition from the record.
//
// # Running it
//
// It needs a real terminal, because sudo asks for a password on one and
// cannot ask anywhere else, and it needs a camp built with the barriers:
//
//	go build -tags camptest -o ~/campcheck/camp-barriers ./cmd/camp
//	go run ./killmatrix -env ~/campcheck -camp ~/campcheck/camp-barriers
//
// Run it as yourself and not with sudo. camp's front end refuses to run
// as root, on purpose, and this drives the front end; the privileged
// steps are the ones camp elevates for itself.
//
// It mounts and unmounts a real composition many times. Point it at a
// scratch environment, never at one you are working in.

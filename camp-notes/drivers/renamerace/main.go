// Command renamerace swaps the environment's name under the privileged
// helper at each of its resolutions, and requires that nothing outside the
// environment changes.
//
// This is the measurement the review asked for by name, and the assertion
// is deliberately not "camp errors". The invoking user owns the
// environment root and normally its parent, so they can rename it away and
// leave a symbolic link at the old name at any instant they choose. camp
// is allowed to notice and refuse, and it is allowed to carry on: what it
// may never do is act at the link's target. The helper is root, and a root
// process that binds, moves, remounts or unmounts wherever a name happens
// to point is a confused deputy -- somebody who can edit a configuration
// would have reached root through it.
//
// So the trap tree is what is measured, not camp's exit code:
//
//   - no mount id outside the original environment changes;
//   - no mount attribute outside it changes;
//   - no inode mode outside it changes;
//   - the trap tree hashes identically before and after.
//
// The four resolutions it swaps at, and what each one is about:
//
//	base-owned         the helper has opened and checked its base
//	prechecked         every operand compared, nothing mounted yet
//	before-move-open   before the move's two descriptors are opened
//	stands-there       teardown: identity checked, before the unmount
//
// # Running it
//
// It needs a real terminal for sudo's prompt and a camp built with the
// barriers:
//
//	go build -tags camptest -o ~/campcheck/camp-barriers ./cmd/camp
//	go run ./renamerace -env ~/campcheck -camp ~/campcheck/camp-barriers
//
// Run it as yourself. It uses sudo for the two things that need root: the
// trap tree, which has to be root-owned and full of mounts nothing else
// on the machine has, and taking that tree down again afterwards.
//
// It renames a real environment and makes real mounts. Point it at a
// scratch environment, never at one you are working in.
